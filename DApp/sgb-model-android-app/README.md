# Android App with QR Scanner and MQTT client 

This application models the Smart Garbage Bins that are garbage bins with qr reader that are IOT devices (Microprocess / controller with network connectivity). When a user wants to throw waste in these garbage bins, he / she is supposed to generate a QR code using the telegram bot (future work). This telegram bot interacts with an edgehub that has records of account. A QR code is generated only when the user will have sufficient balance (the balance is an arbitrary number for now). This QR code has an auth key or a randomly generated character encoded which is read by this mobile application. The app deocdes the random number and publishes a MQTT message to the remote Mosquito Broker and starts a MQTT subscribe to listen to the response of the message. The edge hub is also listening to the same message topic. Upon receiving the decoded QR or random number, it will look up the database for the random number. If the random number is present there, it means that the user is authenticated. Appropriate response will be published to Mosquito broker via MQTT which will be listened by the SGB / Mobile App and an open message will be displayed.
